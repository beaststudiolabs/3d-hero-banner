# Diff Summary

## Intent
Create the mandatory context-preservation baseline for this project by introducing canonical docs and a reproducible save-state checkpoint.

## Added/Updated Scope
- Added project context system under `project-state/`.
- Backfilled full chat decisions into canonical PRD and feature matrix.
- Added baseline build log and checkpoint index.
- Created baseline checkpoint bundle with markdown docs (`diff-summary.md`, `restore.md`); legacy archives were later pruned.

## Files Added
- `beastside-3d-hero-banner/project-state/PRD_ADDENDUM_CANONICAL.md`
- `beastside-3d-hero-banner/project-state/FEATURE_MATRIX.md`
