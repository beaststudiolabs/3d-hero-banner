# Restore

## Purpose
- This is a documentation-only checkpoint; no runtime code was changed.

## Restore Steps
1. Open `beastside-3d-hero-banner/project-state/CURRENT_STATUS.md` for the latest consolidated project state.
2. Use `beastside-3d-hero-banner/project-state/CHECKPOINT_INDEX.md` to locate this checkpoint entry.
3. For rollback of code behavior, continue using the stable rollback target:
   - `20260209-111549-qa-and-release-docs`

## Notes
- Keep `CURRENT_STATUS.md` updated at each major phase boundary or validation handoff.
